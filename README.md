# Wordpress development starting tree

There is a one of possible approaches to develop with Wordpress.
For the current version you can just create a theme in src and gulp will build if for in the ``app/content/themes`` folder.
Plugins can't be under development now.

With the Composer you will have a fresh Wordpress Core under ``app/wp``.

Rename config files from ``app/`` folder with deleting `sample` suffix, and change its content then as you need.

This a raw version. With a lot of gaps for closing.
